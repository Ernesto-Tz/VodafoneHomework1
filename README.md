# Vodafone Homework 1

Contacts application created with JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
Allows the user to add, remove, edit and display contacts.
Additional tools are used on different versions.

- Version 1:  
    Using Vanilla JS, simple structure.

- Version 2:   
    Using webpack and Modules and HTML templates.
    
    Node version 14.16.0

    To run the application: 
    1. `npm install`
    2. `npm run build`
    3. `npm run build:dev`

    Problems: The bootstrap version is old.
        The webpack server has a problem on the developer mode. It is not picking up changes, I need to rebuild manually.


- Version 3:
    Using Vue structure.

    To run the application: 
    1. `npm install`
    2. `npm run serve`
